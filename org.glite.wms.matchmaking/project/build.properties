build.package.summary="Workload Manager MatchMaking Library"
build.package.description="This component basically provides a set of APIs in order to retrieve all the Computing Elements that match with a certain JDL. The Requirements expression in the JDL is evaluated in order to perform the match. Once the resources have been found , they can be ordered by the Rank value. The matchmaking can be used either to check which resources are available for a certain JDL at a certain moment, or to assign a resource where a job will be executed."
