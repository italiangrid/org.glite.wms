	DESCRIPTION

glite-job-submit is the command for submitting jobs to the DataGrid and hence allows the user to run a job at one or several remote resources. glite-job-submit requires as input a job description file in which job characteristics and requirements are expressed by means of Condor class-ad-like expressions.
While it does not matter the order of the other arguments, the job description file has to be the last argument of
this command.

	OPTIONS

	--version
displays UI version.

	--help
displays command usage

	--config, -c <configfile>
if the command is launched with this option, the configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

	--debug
When this option is specified, debugging information is displayed on the standard output and written into the log file, whose location is eventually printed on screen.
The default UI logfile location is:
glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.log  located under the /var/tmp directory
please notice that this path can be overriden with the '--logfile' option

	--logfile <filepath>
when this option is specified, all information is written into the specified file pointed by filepath.
This option will override the default location of the logfile:
glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.log  located under the /var/tmp directory

	--noint
if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)

	--input, -i <filepath>
if this option is specified, the user will be asked to choose a CEId from a list of CEs contained in the filepath. Once a CEId has been selected the command behaves as explained for the resource option. If this option is used together with the --int one and the input file contains more than one CEId, then the first CEId in the list is taken into account for submitting the job.

	--output, -o <filepath>
writes the generated jobId assigned to the submitted job in the file specified by filepath,which can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file is created in the current working directory. Different submission can be performed specifying the same output file, the command appending the new jobId to the existing ones. The output files should not be edited, as a special header is used by Userinterface to parse it.

	--resource, -r <ceid>
This command is available only for jobs.
if this option is specified, the job-ad sent to the NS contains a line of the type "SubmitTo = <ceid>"  and the job is submitted by the WMS to the resource identified by <ceid> without going through the match-making process.

	--nodes-resource <ceid>
This command is available only for dags.
if this option is specified, the job-ad sent to the NS contains a line of the type "SubmitTo = <ceid>"  and the dag is submitted by the WMS to the resource identified by <ceid> without going through the match-making process for each of its nodes.

	--nolisten
This option can be used only for interactive jobs. It makes the command forward the job standard streams coming from the WN to named pipes on the client machine whose names are returned to the user together with the OS id of the listener process. This allows the user to interact with the job through her/his own tools. It is important to note that when this option is specified, the command has no more control over the launched listener process that has hence to be killed by the user (through the returned process id) once the job is finished.

	--nogui
This option can be used only for interactive jobs. As the command for such jobs opens an X window, the user should make sure that an X server is running on the local machine and if she/he is connected to the UI node from a remote machine (e.g. with ssh) enable secure X11 tunneling.
If this is not possible, the user can specify the --nogui option that makes the command provide a simple standard non-graphical interaction with the running job.

	--nomsg
this option makes the command print on the standard output only the jobId generated for the job when submission was successful.The location of the log file containing massages and diagnostics is printed otherwise.

	--chkpt <filepath>
This option can be used only for checkpointable jobs. The state specified as input is a checkpoint state generated by a previously submitted job.  This option makes the submitted job start running from the checkpoint state given in input and not from the very beginning.
The initial checkpoint states to be used with this option can be retrieved by means of the glite-job-get-chkpt command.

	--lrms <lrmstype>
This option is only for MPICH  jobs and must be used together with either --resource or --input option; it specifies the type of the lrms of the resource the user is submitting to. When the batch system type of the specified CE resource given is not known, the lrms must be provided while submitting. For non-MPICH jobs this option will be ignored.

	--valid, -v <hh:mm>
A job for which no compatible CEs have been found during the matchmaking phase is hold in the WMS Task Queue for a certain time so that it can be subjected again to matchmaking from time to time until a compatible CE is found. The JDL ExpiryTime attribute is an integer representing the date and time (in seconds since epoch)until the job request has to be considered valid by the WMS. This option allows to specify the validity in hours and minutes from submission time of the submitted JDL. When this option is used the command sets the value for the ExpiryTime attribute converting appropriately the relative timestamp provided as input. It overrides, if present,the current value. If the specified value exceeds one day from job submission then it is not taken into account by the WMS.

	--config-vo <configfile>
if the command is launched with this option, the VO-specific configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

	--vo <voname>
this option allows the user to specify the name of the Virtual Organisation she/he is currently working for.
If the user proxy contains VOMS extensions then the VO specified through this option is overridden by the default VO contained in the proxy (i.e. this option is only useful when working with non-VOMS proxies).
This option is meaningless when used together with "--config-vo" option


	EXAMPLES

Upon successful submissions, this command returns to the identifier (JobId) assigned to the job

- saves the returned JobId in a file:
glite-job-submit --output jobid.out ./job.jdl

- forces the submission to the resource specified with the -r option:
glite-job-submit -r lxb1111.glite.it:2119/blah-lsf-jra1_low ./job.jdl

- forces the submission of the DAG (the parent and all child nodes) to the resource specified with the --nodes-resources option:
glite-job-submit --nodes-resources lxb1111.glite.it:2119/blah-lsf-jra1_low ./dag.jdl

	--config-vo <configfile>
	--vo <voname>


	DESCRIPTION

This command cancels a job previously submitted using glite-job-submit. Before cancellation, it prompts the user for confirmation.
The cancel request is sent to the Network Server that forwards it to the WM that fulfils it.
glite-job-cancel can remove one or more jobs: the jobs to be removed are identified by their job identifiers (jobIds returned by glite-job-submit) provided as arguments to the command and separated by a blank space.
The result of the cancel operation is reported to the user for each specified jobId.

Allow the user to select the JobId(s) from an input file located in filepath.
The list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list.
Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
When specified toghether with '--noint', all available JobId are selected.
This option cannot be used when one or more jobIds have been specified as extra command argument

	--all
displays status information about all job owned by the user submitting the command. This option can't be used
either if one or more jobIds have been specified or if the --input option has been specified. All LBs
listed in the vo-specific UI configuration file $GLITE_WMS_LOCATION/etc/<vo_name>/glite_wmsui.conf are contacted to
fulfil this request.

sets the detail level of information about the job displayed to the user. Possible values for verb_level are 0 (only JobId and status/event displayed),1 (timestamp and source information added), 2 (all information but jdls displayed), 3 (complete information containing all Jdl strings)

	--from <[MM:DD:]hh:mm[:[CC]YY]>
makes the command query LB for jobs that have been submitted (more precisely entered the "Submitted" status) after the specified date/time.
If only hours and minutes are specified then the current day is taken into account. If the year is not specified then the current year is taken into account.

	--to <[MM:DD:]hh:mm[:[CC]YY]>
makes the command query LB for jobs that have been submitted (more precisely entered the "Submitted" status) before the specified date/time.
If only hours and minutes are specified then the current day is taken into account.
If the year is not specified then the current year is taken into account.

	--user-tag <<tag name>=<tag value>>
makes the command include only jobs that have defined specified usertag name and value

	--status, -s <<status code>>
makes the command query LB for jobs that are in the specified status.
The status value can be either an integer or a (case insensitive) string; the following possible values are allowed:
UNDEF (0), SUBMITTED(1), WAITING(2), READY(3), SCHEDULED(4), RUNNING(5), DONE(6), CLEARED(7), ABORTED(8), CANCELLED(9),
UNKNOWN(10), PURGED(11).
This option can be repeated several times, all status conditions will be considered as in a logical OR operation

(i.e.  -s SUBMITTED --status 3  will query all jobs that are either in SUBMITTED or in READY status)

	--exclude, -e <<status code>>
makes the command query LB for jobs that are NOT in the specified status.
The status value can be either an integer or a (case insensitive) string; the following possible values are allowed:
UNDEF (0), SUBMITTED(1), WAITING(2), READY(3), SCHEDULED(4), RUNNING(5), DONE(6), CLEARED(7), ABORTED(8), CANCELLED(9),
UNKNOWN(10), PURGED(11).
This option can be repeated several times, all status conditions will be considered as in a logical AND operation

(i.e.  -e SUBMITTED --exclude 3  will query all jobs that are neither in SUBMITTED nor in READY status)

	SYNOPSIS
glite-job-logging-info [options] <jobId>

options:

	--version

	--event <<event code>>
	--exclude, -e <<event code>>


	DESCRIPTION

This command queries the LB persistent DB for logging information about jobs previously submitted using glite-job-submit.
The job logging information are stored permanently by the LB service and can be retrieved also after the job has terminated its life-cycle, differently from the bookkeeping information that are in some way "consumed" by the user during the job existence.

	OPTIONS

	--version
displays UI version.

	--help
displays command usage

	--config, -c <configfile>
if the command is launched with this option, the configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

	--debug
When this option is specified, debugging information is displayed on the standard output and written into the log file, whose location is eventually printed on screen.
The default UI logfile location is:
glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.log  located under the /var/tmp directory
please notice that this path can be overriden with the '--logfile' option

	--logfile <filepath>
when this option is specified, all information is written into the specified file pointed by filepath.
This option will override the default location of the logfile:
glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.log  located under the /var/tmp directory

	--noint
if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)

	--input, -i <filepath>
Allow the user to select the JobId(s) from an input file located in filepath.
The list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list.
Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
When specified toghether with '--noint', all available JobId are selected.
This option cannot be used when one or more jobIds have been specified as extra command argument

	--output, -o <filepath>
writes the results of the operation in the file specified by filepath instead of the standard output. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.

	--config-vo <configfile>
if the command is launched with this option, the VO-specific configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

	--verbosity, -v <level>
sets the detail level of information about the job displayed to the user. Possible values for verb_level are 0 (only JobId and status/event displayed),1 (timestamp and source information added), 2 (all information but jdls displayed), 3 (complete information containing all Jdl strings)

	--from <[MM:DD:]hh:mm[:[CC]YY]>
makes the command query LB for jobs that have been submitted (more precisely entered the "Submitted" status) after the specified date/time.
If only hours and minutes are specified then the current day is taken into account. If the year is not specified then the current year is taken into account.

	--to <[MM:DD:]hh:mm[:[CC]YY]>
makes the command query LB for jobs that have been submitted (more precisely entered the "Submitted" status) before the specified date/time.
If only hours and minutes are specified then the current day is taken into account.
If the year is not specified then the current year is taken into account.

	--user-tag <<tag name>=<tag value>>
makes the command include only jobs that have defined specified usertag name and value

	--event <<event code>>
makes the command query specified events for requested jobid(s)
The event code can be either an integer or a (case insensitive) string; the following possible values are allowed:
UNDEF, TRANSFER, ACCEPTED, REFUSED, ENQUEUED, DEQUEUED, HELPERCALL, HELPERRETURN, RUNNING, RESUBMISSION, DONE,
CANCEL, ABORT, CLEAR, PURGE, MATCH, PENDING, REGJOB, CHKPT, LISTENER, CURDESCR, USERTAG, CHANGEACL, NOTIFICATION,
RESOURCEUSAGE, REALLYRUNNING
This option can be repeated several times, all event conditions will be considered as in a logical OR operation

(i.e.  --event  PURGE --event 4  will query, for specified jobid(s), all PURGE and ENQUEUED events)

	--exclude, -e <<event code>>
makes the command exclude specified events for requested jobid(s)
The event code can be either an integer or a (case insensitive) string; the following possible values are allowed:
UNDEF, TRANSFER, ACCEPTED, REFUSED, ENQUEUED, DEQUEUED, HELPERCALL, HELPERRETURN, RUNNING, RESUBMISSION, DONE,
CANCEL, ABORT, CLEAR, PURGE, MATCH, PENDING, REGJOB, CHKPT, LISTENER, CURDESCR, USERTAG, CHANGEACL, NOTIFICATION,
RESOURCEUSAGE, REALLYRUNNING
This option can be repeated several times, all event conditions will be considered as in a logical AND operation

(i.e.  -e PURGE --exclude 4  will query, for specified jobid(s), all events BUT PURGE and ENQUEUED)

	DESCRIPTION

glite-job-list-match displays the list of identifiers of the resources on which the user is authorized and satisfying the job requirements included in the job description file. The CE identifiers are returned either on the standard output or in a file according to the chosen command options, and are strings univocally identifying the CEs published in the IS.
The returned CEIds are listed in decreasing order of rank, i.e. the one with the best (greater) rank is in the first place and so forth.

	OPTIONS

	--version
displays UI version.

	--help

	--output, -o <filepath>
writes the results of the operation in the file specified by filepath instead of the standard output. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.

	--verbose
displays on the standard output the job class-ad that is sent to the Network Server generated from the job description file.
This differs from the content of the job description file since the UI adds to it some attributes that cannot be directly inserted by the user
(e.g., defaults for Rank and Requirements if not provided, VirtualOrganisation etc).

	--rank
displays the "matching" CEIds toghether with their associated ranking values.

	--config-vo <configfile>
if the command is launched with this option, the VO-specific configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

	--vo <voname>
this option allows the user to specify the name of the Virtual Organisation she/he is currently working for.
If the user proxy contains VOMS extensions then the VO specified through this option is overridden by the default VO contained in the proxy (i.e. this option is only useful when working with non-VOMS proxies).
This option is meaningless when used together with "--config-vo" option


	EXAMPLES

1) simple request:
glite-job-list-match ./match.jdl

If the operation succeeds, the output will be a list of CEs

2) request for displays CE rank numbers:
glite-job-list-match --rank ./match.jdl

If the operation succeeds, a list of CEs with their rank numbers is displayed on the standard output

3) saves the result in a file:
glite-job-list-match --output match.out ./match.jdl

If the operation succeeds,a list of CEs is saved in the file match.out in the current working directory

	DESCRIPTION

This commands starts a listener process on the UI machine (grid_console_shadow) that allows attaching to the standard streams of a previously submitted interactive job and displays them on a dedicated window. As the command opens a X window, the user should make sure the DISPLAY environment variable is correctly set and if she/he is connected to the UI node from remote machine (e.g. with ssh) enable secure X11 tunneling

	OPTIONS

	--version
displays UI version.

	--help

	--noint
if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)

	--input, -i <filepath>
Allow the user to select the JobId(s) from an input file located in filepath.
The list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list.

When specified toghether with '--noint', all available JobId are selected.
This option cannot be used when one or more jobIds have been specified as extra command argument

	--nolisten
This option can be used only for interactive jobs. It makes the command forward the job standard streams coming from the WN to named pipes on the client machine whose names are returned to the user together with the OS id of the listener process. This allows the user to interact with the job through her/his own tools. It is important to note that when this option is specified, the command has no more control over the launched listener process that has hence to be killed by the user (through the returned process id) once the job is finished.

	--nogui
This option can be used only for interactive jobs. As the command for such jobs opens an X window, the user should make sure that an X server is running on the local machine and if she/he is connected to the UI node from a remote machine (e.g. with ssh) enable secure X11 tunneling.
If this is not possible, the user can specify the --nogui option that makes the command provide a simple standard non-graphical interaction with the running job.

	--port, -p <<port number>>
make sthe command start a listener on the local machine on the specified port and logs these information to the
LB associated to the job.

GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE="<val min> <val max>" This variable must be set to define a range of ports to be used for inbound connections in the interactivity context.
It is taken into account only by submission of interactive jobs and attach commands

X509_CERT_DIR: This variable may be set to override the default location of the trusted certificates directory, which is normally /etc/grid-security/certificates.

X509_USER_PROXY: This variable may be set to override the default location of the user proxy credentials, which is normally /tmp/x509up_u<uid>.

	FILES

One of the following paths must exist (seeked with the specified order):
- $GLITE_WMS_LOCATION/etc/
- $GLITE_LOCATION/etc/
- /opt/glite/etc/
- /usr/local/etc/
- /etc/

and contain the following UI configuration files:
glite_wmsui_cmd_var.conf, glite_wmsui_cmd_err.conf, glite_wmsui_cmd_help.conf, <voName>/glite_wmsui.conf

- glite_wmsui_cmd_var.conf will contain custom configuration default values
A different configuration file may be specified either by using the --config option or by setting the GLITE_WMSUI_CONFIG_VAR environment variable
here follows a possible example:
[
RetryCount = 3 ;
ErrorStorage= "/tmp" ;
OutputStorage="/tmp";
ListenerStorage = "/tmp" ;
LoggingTimeout = 30 ;
LoggingSyncTimeout = 30 ;
NSLoggerLevel = 0;
DefaultStatusLevel = 1 ;
DefaultLogInfoLevel = 1;
]

- glite_wmsui_cmd_err.conf will contain UI exception mapping between error codes and error messages (no relocation possible)

- glite_wmsui_cmd_help.conf will contain UI long-help information (no relocation possible)

- <voName>/glite_wmsui.conf  will contain User VO-specific attributes.
A different configuration file may be specified either by using the --config-vo option or by setting the GLITE_WMSUI_CONFIG_VO environment variable
here follows a possible example:
[
LBAddresses = { "tigerman.cnaf.infn.it:9000" };
VirtualOrganisation = "egee";
NSAddresses = { "tigerman.cnaf.infn.it:7772" }
]

Besides those files, a valid proxy must be found inside the following path:
/tmp/x509up_u<uid> ( use the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable to override the default location JDL file)
