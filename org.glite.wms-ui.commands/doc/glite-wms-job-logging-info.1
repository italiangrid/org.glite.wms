.SH DESCRIPTION
.SP
.SP

This command queries the LB persistent DB for logging information about jobs previously submitted using glite-wms-job-submit.The job logging information are stored permanently by the LB service and can be retrieved also after the job has terminated its life-cycle, differently from the bookkeeping information that are in some way "consumed" by the user during the job existence.
.SH OPTIONS 
.B --version

.IP
displays WMProxy client and servers version numbers.If the --endpoint option is specified only this service is contacted to retrieve its version. If it is not used, the endpoint contacted is that one specified with GLITE_WMS_WMPROXY_ENDPOINT environment variable. If the option is not specified and the environment variable is not set, all servers listed in the WMProxyEndPoints attribute of the user configuration file are contacted. For each of these service, the returned result will be displayed on the standard output (the version numbers in case of success; otherwise the error message).
.PP
.B --help

.IP
displays command usage
.PP
.B --config, -c <configfile>

.IP
if the command is launched with this option, the configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with --vo option
.PP
.B --vo <voname>

.IP
this option allows the user to specify the Virtual Organisation she/he is currently working for.If the user proxy contains VOMS extensions then the VO specified through this option is overridden by thedefault VO contained in the proxy (i.e. this option is only useful when working with non-VOMS proxies).This option is meaningless when used together with --config-vo option.
.PP
.B --debug

.IP
when this option is specified, debugging information is displayed on the standard output and written also either into the default log file:glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.loglocated under the /var/tmp  directory or in the log file specified with --logfile option.
.PP
.B --logfile <filepath>

.IP
When this option is specified, a command log file (whose pathname is filepath) is created.
.PP
<<OPT>>>--nointif this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)
.PP
.B input, -i <filepath>

.IP
Allow the user to select the JobId(s) from an input file located in filepath.The list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list.Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.When specified toghether with "--noint", all available JobId are selected.This option cannot be used when one or more jobIds have been specified as extra command argument
.PP
.B --output, -o <filepath>

.IP
writes the results of the operation in the file specified by filepath instead of the standard output. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.
.PP
.B --verbosity, -v <level>

.IP
sets the detail level of information about the job displayed to the user. Possible values for level are 0 (only JobId and status/event displayed),1 (timestamp and source information added), 2 (all information but jdls displayed), 3 (complete information containing all Jdl strings)
.PP
.B --from <[MM:DD:]hh:mm[:[CC]YY]>

.IP
makes the command query LB for jobs that have been submitted (more precisely entered the "Submitted" status) after the specified date/time.If only hours and minutes are specified then the current day is taken into account. If the year is not specified then the current year is taken into account.
.PP
.B --to <[MM:DD:]hh:mm[:[CC]YY]>

.IP
makes the command query LB for jobs that have been submitted (more precisely entered the "Submitted" status) before the specified date/time.If only hours and minutes are specified then the current day is taken into account.If the year is not specified then the current year is taken into account.
.PP
.B --user-tag <tag name>=<tag value>

.IP
makes the command include only jobs that have defined specified usertag name and value
.PP
.B --event <event code>

.IP
makes the command query specified events for requested jobid(s)The event code can be either an integer or a (case insensitive) string; the following possible values are allowed:UNDEF, TRANSFER, ACCEPTED, REFUSED, ENQUEUED, DEQUEUED, HELPERCALL, HELPERRETURN, RUNNING, RESUBMISSION, DONE,CANCEL, ABORT, CLEAR, PURGE, MATCH, PENDING, REGJOB, CHKPT, LISTENER, CURDESCR, USERTAG, CHANGEACL, NOTIFICATION,RESOURCEUSAGE, REALLYRUNNINGThis option can be repeated several times, all event conditions will be considered as in a logical OR operation(i.e.  --event  PURGE --event 4  will query, for specified jobid(s), all PURGE and ENQUEUED events)
.PP
.B --exclude -e <event code>

.IP
makes the command exclude specified events for requested jobid(s)The event code can be either an integer or a (case insensitive) string; the following possible values are allowed:UNDEF, TRANSFER, ACCEPTED, REFUSED, ENQUEUED, DEQUEUED, HELPERCALL, HELPERRETURN, RUNNING, RESUBMISSION, DONE,CANCEL, ABORT, CLEAR, PURGE, MATCH, PENDING, REGJOB, CHKPT, LISTENER, CURDESCR, USERTAG, CHANGEACL, NOTIFICATION,RESOURCEUSAGE, REALLYRUNNINGThis option can be repeated several times, all event conditions will be considered as in a logical AND operation(i.e.  -e PURGE --exclude 4  will query, for specified jobid(s), all events BUT PURGE and ENQUEUED)
