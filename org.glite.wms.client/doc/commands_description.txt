###glite-wms-job-submit###
<<<SYNOPSIS>>>
[options]  <jdl_file>
<<<SYNOPSIS>>>

<<<DESCRIPTION>>>
glite-wms-job-submit is the command for submitting simple jobs, DAGs, collections and parametric jobs to the WMProxy service: hence allows the user to run these  jobs at one or several remote resources. It requires as input a job description file in which
job characteristics and requirements are expressed by means of Condor class-ad-like expressions. While it
does not matter the order of the other arguments, the job description file has to be the last argument of
this command.

Submission can be performed either by using a proxy previously delegated to the WMProxy (for example with the glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy command)
or delegating a new proxy at each new submission ("automatic delegation").

In the former case the the --delegationid (-d) option must be used, specifying the id string associated with the delegated proxy.

E.g.:

1) glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy --delegationid mydelegID

2) glite-wms-job-submit --delegationid mydelegID myjob.jdl

For automatic delegation the --autm-delegation (-a) option must be used.
Only one of these two options must be specified.

 For job collections there is a further way to perform submission. The --collection option allows indeed to
  specify the path to a directory containing all the single JDL files of the jobs you want the collection is
  made of. The glite-wms-job-submit will generate the corresponding collection JDL and submit it. E.g.:

 glite-wms-job-submit -d mydelegID  --collection /home/glite/KOLL/

  where /home/glite/KOLL/ is the directory containing all the JDL files.


  In all cases, upon success, the command returns an ID to the user that can be used as the handle to follow
  up the progress of the request itself.

While it does not matter the order of the other arguments, the JDL file has to be the last argument of this command (jdl_file).

Upon successful submissions, this command returns to the identifier (JobId) assigned to the job

1) submission with automatic credential delegation:
	glite-wms-job-submit -a ./job.jdl

2) submission with a proxy previously delegated with "exID" id-string; request for displays CE rank numbers:
	glite-wms-job-submit -d exID  ./job.jdl

3) sends the request to the WMProxy service whose URL is specified with the -e option  (where a proxy has been previously delegated with "exID" id-string)
	glite-wms-job-submit -d exID -e https://wmproxy.glite.it:7443/glite_wms_wmproxy_server  ./job.jdl

4) saves the returned JobId in a file:
	glite-wms-job-submit -a --output jobid.out ./job.jdl

5 ) submits a collection whose JDL files are located in $HOME/collection_ex
	glite-wms-job-submit -d exID --collection $HOME/collection_ex

###glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy###
<<<SYNOPSIS>>>
[options]
<<<SYNOPSIS>>>
<<<DESCRIPTION>>>
allows delegating a user proxy to the WMProxy service. The user can either specify the delegationid to be associated with the delegated proxy by using the --delegationid option:

 glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy -d mydelegationiD

or make the command automatically generate an ID by using the --autm-delegation option.

One of these two options is mandatory.
If a delegation with the same id and belonging to the same user already exists in the WMProxy service, the new proxy will overwrite the one associated to that delegation id.
Credential delegation with the same id used for a proxy belonging to another user is possible.

<<<SYNOPSIS>>>

<<<DESCRIPTION>>>
cancels a job previously submitted using glite-job-submit. Before cancellation, it prompts the user for confirmation. The cancel request is sent to the Network Server that forwards it to the WM that fulfills it. glite-wms-job-cancel can remove one or more jobs: the jobs to be removed are identified by their job identifiers (jobIds returned by glite-job-submit) provided as arguments to the command and separated by a blank space. The result of the cancel operation is reported to the user for each specified jobId.

###glite-wms-job-perusal###
<<<SYNOPSIS>>>
[options] <jobId>
<<<SYNOPSIS>>>

<<<DESCRIPTION>>>
Allows handling files perusal functionalities for a submitted job identified by the jobId.
This can be done only when files perusal support has been enabled while submitting/registering the job.
This is accomplished via the 'PerusalFileEnable' JDL attribute.

Three different operations can be performed for a given job:

- Job's file perusal set (--set option): it allows enabling the perusal functionality for one or more specified files.

This option requires the user to specify the file(s) to be perused: this can be done by using either the --filename (multiple files can be specified by repeating the option several times) or the --input option (the user will be prompted to select one or more files).

- Job's file perusal get (--get option): it allows retrieving chunks of one
  specified job's file previously set for perusal by means of the --set option.

This option requires the user to specify the file to be retrieved: this can be done by using either the --filename (no multiple files support available) or the --input option (the user will be prompted to select one file). The specified file is therefore downloaded on the local machine and it can be viewed on the user shell. User can specify a custom directory where to download the files by using the --dir option. The retrieval of files to be perused is available as soon as the job has started running: the command will retrieve the content of the generated file up to the time of the call. By default, any further call on the same file, retrieves back only the last chunks of the file, that means only the information stored after the last call. To retrieve all chunks of a given file (even those that might have been previously retrieved), the --all option must be specified.

- Job's file perusal unset (--unset option): it disables perusal for all job's files (no further option required)

All Perusal functionalities are available for simple jobs and for nodes of compound jobs (like DAGs, collections and parametric jobs) but not for compound jobs as a whole. Moreover the WMProxy service version must be greater than or equal to 2.0.0 (the service version can be retrieved by using the --version option of the client commands).

A message with the result of the operation is displayed on the standard output

2) file retrieval :
	a] download the last chunk of a file in the default directory (/tmp/<jobId_UniqueStr> unless otherwise specified in the command config file):

		glite-wms-job-perusal --get --filename file1.pr https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg

		glite-wms-job-perusal --get --filename file2.txt --all https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg

3) disable files perusal for the given job:
