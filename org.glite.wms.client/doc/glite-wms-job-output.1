.SH DESCRIPTION

can be used to retrieve the output files of a job that has been submitted through the glite-wms-job-submit command with a job description file including the OutputSandbox attribute.
After the submission, when the job has terminated its execution, the user can download the files generated by the job and temporarily stored on the RB machine as specified by the OutputSandbox attribute, issuing the glite-wms-job-output with as input the jobId returned by the glite-job-submit..SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB--version\fR

.IP
displays WMProxy client and servers version numbers.
If the --endpoint option is specified only this service is contacted to retrieve its version. If it is not used, the endpoint contacted is that one specified with GLITE_WMS_WMPROXY_ENDPOINT environment variable. If the option is not specified and the environment variable is not set, all servers listed in the \emph{WMProxyEndPoints} attribute of the user configuration file are contacted. For each of these service, the returned result will be displayed on the standard output (the version numbers in case of success; otherwise the error message).

.HP
\fB--config\fR, \fB-c\fR
<configfile>

.IP
if the command is launched with this option, the configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used toghether with "--vo" option
.PP
.HP
\fB--vo\fR
<voname>

.IP
this option allows the user to specify the Virtual Organisation she/he is currently working for.
If the user proxy contains VOMS extensions then the VO specified through this option is overridden by the
default VO contained in the proxy (i.e. this option is only useful when working with non-VOMS proxies).
This option is meaningless when used toghether with "--vo" option
.PP
.HP
\fB--debug\fR

.IP
when this option is specified, debugging information is displayed on the standard output and written also either into the default log file:

glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.log

located under the \emph{/var/tmp} directory or in the log file specified with --logfile option.
.PP
.HP
\fB--logfile\fR
<filepath>

.IP
When this option is specified, a command log file (whose pathname is \emph{filepath}) is created.
.PP
.HP
\fB--noint\fR

.IP
if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)
.PP
.HP
\fB--input\fR, \fB-i\fR
<filepath>

.IP
this option makes the command return the OutputSandbox files for each jobId contained in the filepath. This option can't be used if one (or more) jobIds have been already specified. The format of the input file must be as follows: one jobId for each line and comment lines must begin with a "#" or a "*" character. When this option is used, the list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas.
E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list. Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. "3-6" selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs.
E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
.PP
.HP
\fB--dir\fR
<directorypath>

.IP
if this option is specified, the retrieved files (previously listed by the user through the OutputSandbox attribute of the job description file) are stored in the location indicated by directory_path.
.PP
.HP
\fB--list-only\fR

.IP
when this option is specified, the output files (previously listed by the user through the OutputSandbox attribute of the job description file) are not retrieved. The command only displays the list of URIs indicating where they are currently located.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

GLITE_WMS_CLIENT_CONFIG:  This variable may be set to specify the path location of the configuration file

GLITE_WMS_LOCATION:  This variable must be set when the Glite WMS installation is not located in the default paths: either /opt/glite or /usr/local

GLITE_LOCATION: This variable must be set when the Glite installation is not located in the default paths: either  /opt/glite or /usr/local

GLOBUS_LOCATION: This variable must be set when the Globus installation is not located in the default path /opt/globus

X509_CERT_DIR: This variable may be set to override the default location of the trusted certificates directory, which is normally /etc/grid-security/certificates

X509_USER_PROXY: This variable may be set to override the default location of the user proxy credentials, which is normally /tmp/x509up_u<uid>.
.SH FILES

voName/glite_wms.conf		The user configuration file. The standard path location is $GLITE_WMS_LOCATION/etc (or $GLITE_LOCATION/etc); different configuration files
can be specified by either using the --config option or setting the GLITE_WMS_CLIENT_CONFIG environment variable

/tmp/x509up_u<uid>.A valid X509 user proxy; use the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable to override the default location.SH AUTHORS

1) glite-wms-job-output https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg

if the operation succeeds, the /tmp/<jobId-UniqueString> directory contains the retrieved files

2)	glite-wms-job-output --dir $HOME/my_dir https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg

if the operation succeeds, the $HOME/my_dir directory contains the retrieved files

3)	request for output of multiple jobs:
glite-wms-job-output https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/wqikja_-de83jdqd https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/jdh_wpwkd134ywhq6p

if the operation succeeds, each /tmp/<jobId-UniqueString> directory contains the retrieved files for the corresponding job

4)	the myids.in input file contains the jobid(s)
glite-wms-job-output --input myids.in
if the operation succeeds, each /tmp/<jobId-UniqueString> directory contains the retrieved files for the corresponding job
