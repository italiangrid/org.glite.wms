<<<all>>>
This option can only be specified together with --get: all chunks of the specified file will be downloaded (even those that might have been previously retrieved)
<<<all>>>

<<<autm-delegation>>>
this option is specified to make automatic generation of the identifier string (delegationid) that will be associated to the delegated proxy. It must be used in place of the --delegationId (-d) option.
<<<autm-delegation>>>

<<<cancel-input>>>
cancels jobs whose jobIds are contained in the file located in filepath. This option cannot be used if one or more jobIds have been specified. If the --noint is not specified, the list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list.
Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included).
It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
<<<cancel-input>>>

<<<perusal-inputfile>>>
this option can be used only when --set or --get option are specified too. It
allows the user to specify respectively the job's file(s) to be perused or retrieved. The list of files contained in <filepath> is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. With the --set option multiple files can be specified by selecting more items from the list. Instead, multiple files cannot be specified with --get.

This option is ignored if used with the --unset option.
<<<perusal-inputfile>>>

<<<cancel-output>>>
writes the cancellation results in the file specified by filepath instead of the standard output. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.
<<<cancel-output>>>

<<<collection>>>
this option allows specifying  the directory pointed by directory_path containing all the single JDL files of the jobs that the collection will be made of. The corresponding collection JDL will be generated and submitted. Using this option the jdl_file (the last argument) must not be specified. Please note that the directory specified through the --collection option MUST only contain JDL files describing simple jobs (i.e. no DAGs, no collections). All job types are admitted but "partitionable" and "parametric".
<<<collection>>>

<<<config>>>
if the command is launched with this option, the configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option
<<<config>>>


<<<debug>>>
when this option is specified, debugging information is displayed on the standard output and written also either into the default log file:

glite-wms-job-<command_name>_<uid>_<pid>_<time>.log

located under the /var/tmp directory or in the log file specified with --logfile option.
<<<debug>>>

<<<delegationid>>>
if this option is specified, the proxy that will be delegated is identified by <id_string>. This proxy can be therefore used for operations like job registration, job submission and job list matching until its expiration specifying the <id_string>. It must be used in place of --autm-delegation option.
<<<delegationid>>>

<<<deleg-output>>>
if this option is specified, the following information is saved in the file specified by filepath: date and time the delegation operation was performed; WMProxy service URL;  id_string associated to the delegated proxy. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file is created in the current working directory.
<<<deleg-output>>>

<<<endpoint>>>
when this option is specified, the operations are performed contacting the WMProxy service represented by the given serviceURL. If it is not used, the endpoint contacted is that one specified by the GLITE_WMS_WMPROXY_ENDPOINT environment variable. If both this option is not specified and the environment variable is not set, the service request will be sent to one of the endpoints listed in the WMProxyEndPoints attribute in the user configuration file (randomly chosen among the URLs of the attribute list). If the chosen service is not available, a succession of attempts are performed on the other specified services until the connection with one of these endpoints can be established or all services have been contacted without success. In this latter case the operation can not be obviously performed and the execution of the command is stopped with an error message.
<<<endpoint>>>

<<<filename>>>
this option can be used only when --set or --get option are specified too. It allows the user to specify the job's file(s) to be perused or retrieved. With the --set option multiple files can be specified by repeating the option several times. Instead, multiple files cannot be specified with --get.

e.g.: --filename <file1>  --filename <file2>  --filename <file3>  ..etc

This option is ignored if used with the --unset option.
<<<filename>>>

<<<get>>>
if this option is specified, the file specified with the --filename option is downloaded on the local machine. Multiple files can not be specified. This option cannot be specified together with --set and --unset.
<<<get>>>

<<<help>>>
displays command usage
<<<help>>>


<<<jobout-dir>>>
if this option is specified, the retrieved files (previously listed by the user through the OutputSandbox attribute of the job description file) are stored in the location indicated by directory_path.
<<<jobout-dir>>>

<<<jobout-input>>>
this option makes the command return the OutputSandbox files for each jobId contained in the filepath. This option can't be used if one (or more) jobIds have been already specified. The format of the input file must be as follows: one jobId for each line and comment lines must begin with a "#" or a "*" character. When this option is used, the list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas.
E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list. Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. "3-6" selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs.
E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
<<<jobout-input>>>

<<<list-only>>>
when this option is specified, the output files (previously listed by the user through the OutputSandbox attribute of the job description file) are not retrieved. The command only displays the list of URIs indicating where they are currently located.
<<<list-only>>>

<<<logfile>>>
When this option is specified, a command log file (whose pathname is filepath) is created.
<<<logfile>>>

<<<lrms>>>
This option is only for MPICH  jobs and must be used together with either --resource or --input option; it specifies the type of the lrms of the resource the user is submitting to. When the batch system type of the specified CE resource given is not known, the lrms must be provided while submitting. For non-MPICH jobs this option will be ignored.
<<<lrms>>>

<<<match-output>>>
returns the CEIds list in the file specified by filepath. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.
<<<match-output>>>

<<<nodisplay>>>
this option can only be specified together with the --get one; it ends the execution of the command without displaying the content of the downloaded files. This option is ignored if used with --set or --unset.
<<<nodisplay>>>

<<<noint>>>
if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)
<<<noint>>>


<<<nolisten>>>
This option can be used only for interactive jobs. It makes the command forward the job standard streams coming from the WN to named pipes on the client machine whose names are returned to the user together with the OS id of the listener process. This allows the user to interact with the job through her/his own tools. It is important to note that when this option is specified, the command has no more control over the launched listener process that has hence to be killed by the user (through the returned process id) once the job is finished.

<<<nolisten>>>

<<<nomsg>>>
this option makes the command print on the standard output only the jobId generated for the job if submission was successful; the location of the log file containing massages and diagnostics is printed otherwise.
<<<nomsg>>>

<<<perusal-dir>>>
if this option is specified, the retrieved files are stored in the location pointed by directory_path instead of the default location /tmp/<jobId unique string>. This option is ignored if used with either the --set or the --get options.
<<<perusal-dir>>>

<<<perusal-output>>>
this option can only be used together with either the --set or with the --get option.
Information about these two operations are saved in the file specified by filepath at the end of the execution: for --set the filename(s) for which perusal has been enabled; for --get the local pathnames to the retrieved files. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the local machine). In the former case the file is created in the current working directory.
<<<perusal-output>>>


<<<proto>>>
this option specifies the protocol to be used for file tranferring. It will be ignored when the specified protocol is not found among WMProxy service available protocols: in this case the default one (generally gsiftp ) will be used instead.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<proto>>>


<<<proto-submit>>>
this option specifies the protocol to be used for file tranferring. It will be ignored when the specified protocol is not found among WMProxy service available protocols: in this case the default one (generally gsiftp ) will be used instead.
<<<proto-submit>>>


<<<rank>>>
displays the "matching" CEIds and the associated ranking values.
<<<rank>>>


<<<register-only>>>
if this option is specified, the job is only registered to the WMProxy service. Local files that could be in the JDL InputSandbox attribute are not transferred unless the --transfer-files is also specified; and the job is not started. If the --transfer-files option is not specified, the command displays the list of the local files to be transferred before starting the job. In this list each local file is matched to the corresponding Destination URI where it has to be transferred. The URIs are referred to either the default protocol (gsiftp) or another protocol specified by --proto.  Not using the--transfer-files option, users can transfer these files by low level commands like either globus-url-copy or curl. After having transferred all files, the job can be started launching again this command with the --start option:
glite-wms-job-submit --start <jobid>
<<<register-only>>>

<<<resource>>>
This command is available only for jobs.
if this option is specified, the job-ad sent to the NS contains a line of the type "SubmitTo = <ceid>"  and the job is submitted by the WMS to the resource identified by <ceid> without going through the match-making process.
<<<resource>>>

<<<nodes-resource>>>
This command is available only for dags.
if this option is specified, the job-ad sent to the NS contains a line of the type "SubmitTo = <ceid>"  and the dag is submitted by the WMS to the resource identified by <ceid> without going through the match-making process for each of its nodes.
<<<nodes-resource>>>

<<<set>>>
if this option is specified, files perusal is enabled for the job (indicated by JobId) for the file(s) specified through the --filename option. Multiple files can be specified by repeating the option several times ( e.g.: --filename <file1>  --filename <file2>  --filename <file3>  ..etc). This option cannot be specified together with --get and --unset.
<<<set>>>

<<<start>>>
this option allowing starting a job (specified by JobId) previously registered and whose InputSandbox files on the submitting machine have been already transferred to the WMProxy machine.
<<<start>>>

<<<submit-input>>>
if this option is specified, the user will be asked to choose a CEId from a list of CEs contained in the filepath. Once a CEId has been selected the command behaves as explained for the resource option. If this option is used together with the --int one and the input file contains more than one CEId, then the first CEId in the list is taken into account for submitting the job.
<<<submit-input>>>

<<<submit-output>>>
writes the generated jobId assigned to the submitted job in the file specified by filepath,which can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file is created in the current working directory.
<<<submit-output>>>

<<<to>>>
A job for which no compatible CEs have been found during the matchmaking phase is hold in the WMS Task Queue for a certain time so that it can be subjected again to matchmaking from time to time until a compatible CE is found. The JDL ExpiryTime attribute is an integer representing the date and time (in seconds since epoch) until the job request has to be considered valid by the WMS. This option sets the value for the ExpiryTime attribute to the submitted JDL converting appropriately the absolute timestamp provided as input. It overrides, if present, the current value. If the specified value exceeds one day from job submission then it is not taken into account by the WMS.
<<<to>>>

<<<transfer-files>>>
this option must be only used with the --register-only option. It enables transferring operation for files in the JDL InputSandbox attribute located on the submitting machine. These files are transferred to the WMProxy machine.
<<<transfer-files>>>

<<<unset>>>
if this option is specified, files perusal is disabled for the given job.
This option cannot be specified together with --set and --get.
<<<unset>>>


<<<valid>>>
A job for which no compatible CEs have been found during the matchmaking phase is hold in the WMS Task Queue for a certain time so that it can be subjected again to matchmaking from time to time until a compatible CE is found. The JDL ExpiryTime attribute is an integer representing the date and time (in seconds since epoch)until the job request has to be considered valid by the WMS. This option allows to specify the validity in hours and minutes from submission time of the submitted JDL. When this option is used the command sets the value for the ExpiryTime attribute converting appropriately the relative timestamp provided as input. It overrides, if present,the current value. If the specified value exceeds one day from job submission then it is not taken into account by the WMS.
<<<valid>>>


<<<version>>>
displays WMProxy client and servers version numbers.
If the --endpoint option is specified only this service is contacted to retrieve its version. If it is not used, the endpoint contacted is that one specified with GLITE_WMS_WMPROXY_ENDPOINT environment variable. If the option is not specified and the environment variable is not set, all servers listed in the WMProxyEndPoints attribute of the user configuration file are contacted. For each of these service, the returned result will be displayed on the standard output (the version numbers in case of success; otherwise the error message).
<<<version>>>

<<<vo>>>
this option allows the user to specify the Virtual Organisation she/he is currently working for.
If the user proxy contains VOMS extensions then the VO specified through this option is overridden by the
default VO contained in the proxy (i.e. this option is only useful when working with non-VOMS proxies).
This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option
<<<vo>>>


<<<dag>>>
this option allows specifying  the directory pointed by directory_path containing all the single JDL files of the jobs that the dag will be made of. The corresponding dag JDL will be generated and submitted. Using this option the jdl_file (the last argument) must not be specified.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<dag>>>


<<<default-jdl>>>
Allow specifying a further jdl file whose attributes will be merged into the submitting jdl (if not yet present).
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<default-jdl>>>

<<<proxy>>>
Retrieves and displays information for the proxy delegated with the specified JobId: the WMProxy service where the job was submitted is contacted and asked for needed information.
<<<proxy>>>

<<<jdl>>>
Retrieves and displays the jdl registered to the LB service for the specified JobId: the WMProxy service where the job was submitted is contacted and asked for needed information.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<jdl>>>

<<<jdl-original>>>
Retrieves and displays the original jdl submitted by the user to the WMProxy service. This information might be quite different from the registered jdl, mostly for parametric and collection of jobs.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<jdl-original>>>

<<<info-output>>>
Stores the retrieved information into the specified file instead of the standard output. The specified file path can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<info-output>>>
