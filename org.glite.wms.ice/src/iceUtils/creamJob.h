	/*!\class CreamJob 
	  CreamJob is a class describing what a job is for ICE:
	  - a cream job identifier string as returned by the CREAM service after a JDL has been registered
	  - a edg job id string that represents the unique identifier of the user's job in the entire grid
	  - a jdl string that describe the user job
	  - the address of the CREAM service where the job has been submitted
	  - the address of the CREAMDelegation service that is the URL of the service that perform user proxy delegation
	  - the path of the user proxy certificate
	  - the status of the job (PENDING, IDLE, RUNNING, DONE-OK, DONE-FAILED, ABORTED etc.)
	  - last time of update that is the time of the last status update
