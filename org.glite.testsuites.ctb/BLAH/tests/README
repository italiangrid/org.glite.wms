Python BLAH testing scripts - README
====================================
How to run: blah_submit_status.py, blah_cancel.py, blah_hold_resume.py


On the CE node:

1) The testing scripts under 'org.glite.testsuites.ctb/BLAH/tests/' together with 'functions.py'  have to be 
   copied and run directly on the CE where BLAH is running, under the user dir for which a valid user proxy 
   is owned
 
2) Copy also the classadd_job file on the CE (under the same dir) and use as it is or add the particular 
   classadd job that has to be tested. The format should be the same as the ones that are already in 
   the 'classad_job' file, add a new line for each new classad job file. 
   The script will loop through the file and perform a test on every job that is given as input in the 
   classadd_job file, the output will be given in an html type format as in the SAM testing suite

3) Copy a valid user proxy under the user home dir on the CE, like for example '/home/egee002/' and run the 
   scripts as user 'egee002' directly from '/home/egee002'
