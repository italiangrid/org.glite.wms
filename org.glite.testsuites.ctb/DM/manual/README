The DM-certtest.sh script is a meta-script that can be used to launch all the Data Management related tests.
Before calling the meta-script the configuration file DM-certconfig must be edited.
In the DM-certconfig script you have to specify some options plus the set of tests to run.
At the moment dCache produces some errors, so it has been exluded from the tests.

The DM-certtest.sh must be launched from the currect directory.

When it succeedes the script print TEST_PASSED at the end.
If it fails it will write which tests failed and which text files you have to look for the error messages.
