The DM-certtest.sh script is a meta-testscript that can be used to launch all the Data Management related tests.
Before calling the meta-testscript the configuration file DM-testconfig must be edited.
In the DM-testconfig script you have to specify some options plus the set of tests to run.
At the moment dCache produces some errors, so it has been exluded from the tests.

The DM-certtest.sh must be launched from the currect directory.
For any question contact Gianni.Pucciani@cern.ch

When it succeedes the script print TEST_PASSED at the end.
If it fails it will write which tests failed and which text files you have to look for the error messages.
