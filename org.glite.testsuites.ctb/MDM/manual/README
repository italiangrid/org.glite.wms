Tests for the MDM suite
Author: Kalle Happonen <kalle.happonen@cern.ch>

These scripts are the certifications test scripts for the MDM server and
client. These aren't separated at this point, the tests need to be revised once
this happens. All test should be run from the same machine, with an user
account that has enough privileges (certificate) to register and remove mdm
images.

All script configuration is done in congfig.sh, or by setting the appropriate
environment variables. If nothing is specified, the defaults are used. The
tests need the glite-UI to be set up properly. A default DICOM test image is
supplied. 

All test are ran without parameters, and return 0 on success and 1 on error.
The tests need at least one valid proxy certificate. 

The more advanced tests use the commands tested in simpler ones, so the
recommended execution order of the tests are:

service-ping-test.sh
register-test.sh
retrieval-test.sh
permission-test.sh

functions.sh and config.sh are support files.
