--- VOBOX TEST SCRIPT ---

Description
-----------
The VOBOX test script (lcg_vobox_test.pl) is a Perl script that performs
some checks to verify the correct functioning of the VOBOX.
The script has been derived from an existing script developed for
the ALICE VO.

The tests that are performed are:
  1- the proxy renewal service is up and running
  2- the user proxy registration mechanism is up and working
  3- the machine is properly defined within the myproxy server and that connections 
     with BDII are properly established
  4- the proxy of the machine is up and running
  5- the delegation procedure is working properly
  6- the access to the software area is guaranteed 

Setting up the VOBOX
--------------------
In order to install and configure properly a VOBOX for patch certification purposes,
the following steps must be done:

- Register the VOBOX into the MyProxy server
Ask Louis.Poncet@cern.ch (or Di.Qing@cern.ch) to modify the configuration
of the MyProxy server in order to include the VOBOX machine.

- Install and configure a VOBOX node
On a virtual machine of the VTB, install the CAs (lcg-CA), set hostkey and 
hostcert correctly, then download the glite-VOBOX.repo file and install the VOBOX 
(glite-VOBOX).
The variable that must be set in the site-info.def file in order to 
configure the VOBOX with yaim are the following:
PX_HOST
VOBOX_HOST
BDII_HOST
SITE_BDII_HOST
LB_HOST

Configure the VOBOX with yaim.

Logging into the VOBOX and calling the script
---------------------------------------------
The examples here reported have been done using the vobox  vtb-generic-28.cern.ch, the
myproxy server on lxbra2304.cern.ch and the voms server lxbra2309.cern.ch.

From a UI get a VOMS proxy with lcg-admin role (ensure that you have those roles
beforehand).
Example:
voms-proxy-init --voms dteam:/dteam/Role=lcgadmin -voms lxbra2309.cern.ch

Upload a long-lived proxy into the MyProxy server:
Example:
myproxy-init -s lxbra2304.cern.ch -d -n -t 48 -c 720

Login into the VOBOX using the sgmdtm01 account:
gsissh -p 1975 -l sgmdtm01 vtb-generic-28.cern.ch

Make sure that the $MYPROXY_SERVER points to the correct server.

Register the login proxy to the VO-Box Proxy Renewal Service:
Example:
[sgmdtm01@vtb-generic-28 ~]$ vobox-proxy --vo dteam --voms dteam:/dteam/Role=lcgadmin register

Download the perl script from the CVS repository and run it:
Example:
[sgmdtm01@vtb-generic-28 ~]$ perl lcg_vobox_test.pl -node vtb-generic-28
080820143243SCRIPTRESULT        Status  0

Checking the output
-------------------
The script will create a directory with the host name (vtb-generic-28 in this case)
and in this directory, for each test, a file named vobox-test-n.result (n=number of 
the test) will be created with the outcome of the test.

The following outcome must be verified:

1- Proxy renewal service (/etc/init.d/dteam-box-proxyrenewal) is up and running
2- User Proxy Registration mechanism is up and working
3- succesfull test: The machine is properly defined within myproxy server and 
   connections with BDII are properly established 
4- The proxy of the machine is up and running
5- The delegation procedure is working properly: 'timeleft' => 621330
6- The access to the software area is guaranteed
