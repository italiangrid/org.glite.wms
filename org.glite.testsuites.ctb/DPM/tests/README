DPM tests

This directory contins various tests for testing
a DPM machine. They are not complete , however 
in a working state and can be further developed.

To run the test:

./start <machine name> <vo>

Example:

./start lxb1921.cern.ch org.glite.voms-test


Notes:

1.)
To run the test you need a valid credential, and the
DPM/DPNS client libraries has to be installed on the
usual location. You can use a UI for this purpose.

2.)
Don't forget to run the tests under 3 different scenario:

    1.) with plain grid proxy
    2.) with voms proxy
    3.) with voms proxy with a role
