The LFC-certtest.sh script is a meta-script that can be used to launch all the LFC related tests.
Before calling the meta-script the configuration file LFC-certconfig must be edited.
In the LFC-certconfig script you have to specify some options plus the set of tests to run.

Currently the following tests are failing:
LFC-addreplica
LFC-addreplicax
LFC-getreplica
LFC-getreplicas

The LFC-certtest.sh must be launched from the currect directory.

When it succeedes the script print TEST_PASSED at the end.
If it fails it will write which tests failed and which text files you have to look for the error messages.
