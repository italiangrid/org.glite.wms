How to use this test:

 To test an MPI c program, just execute:

    cd c ; edg-job-submit mpi-test.jdl
    
    This will launch the c mpi program and it will compile it
    on the worker node itseld.

 To test an MPI Fortran program, just execute:

    cd fortran; edg-job-submit mpi-start-fortran.jdl

    Note, that the MPI capable CE has to publis 'pbs' as LRMS instead of 'torque'.
