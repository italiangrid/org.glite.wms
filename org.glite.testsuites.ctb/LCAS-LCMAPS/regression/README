Regression test(s)

These regression tests are outside th regression test framework since they need
extra work for the setup. 

====bug52054====

Setup:

You need a node with glexec installed (eg. glite-GLEXEC_wn). The node also
needs the voms-clients (glite-security-voms-clients). Both should be configured
and working (eg you need to run the config_vomses yaim function). Then you need
a valid proxy and X509_USER_PROXY should be set.

Running:

Just run ./bug52054 and it tells you if it finds the bug again
