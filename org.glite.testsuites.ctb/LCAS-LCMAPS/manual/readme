Test instructions for LCAS

LCAS is used on a variety of nodetypes, and it should be certified that they work on all of them. However, the real tests that test the LCAS functionality only need to be tested on one nodetype. 

I have chosen to test these on the glite-WMS, since than means that you only have to set up a WMS and a UI for the tests. The tests can be modified for testing on other nodetypes, the server part should not need any changes.

The tests test the LCAS by trying to submit jobs to the WMS with different WMS configurations and different credentials.

Setup
=====

To set the tests up, install one WMS machine and one UI machine, and make the UI machine use the WMS as default. You don't need to set up CE's, the jobs can be submitted to the UI even if there aren't any CEs to forward them to. You also need two certificates.

Just put test-setup-server.sh on the server and test-run.sh on the UI. There are default values in the scripts you may need to change, the assumtption is that you use the CERN certification testbed and Test User 100 and Test User 101 certificates.

Running
=======

On the server run ./test-setup-server.sh --phase 1 and it sets up the configuration on the server. Then run ./test-run.sh --phase 1 on the UI. Repeat with --phase 2 and --phase 3 on both server and client. If all goes well, the tests pass, and that's it.
