Tests for the Hydra server and client
Author: Kalle Happonen <kalle.happonen@cern.ch>

These scripts are prepared for testing the hydra server and client
functionality. hydra-server-test.sh is meant to be run on the server(s), the
rest of the tests need to be run on the client. For the testing purposes these
can be installed on the same machine. 

All script configuration is done in config.sh, or by setting the appropriate
environment variables. If nothing is specified, the defaults are used. The
client tests need the glite-UI to be set up properly.

All test are ran without parameters, and return 0 on success and 1 on error.
The client tests need at least one valid proxy certificate. If another one is
available, chmod-test.sh and acl-test.sh test that the permissions/ACL are
enforced. 

stress-test.sh is for stress testing the hydra performance. It starts 10
processes which each register and unregister 100 keys (default). Amount of
processes and keys can be changed. Using too many processes might not benchmark
the server correctly, since the key generation is cpu intensive and may slow
down the test machine. If you run all three hydra servers on one machine, it
does three times more work than in a normal situation.

The more advanced tests use the commands tested in simpler ones, so the
recommended execution order on the client is:

ssss-test.sh
keyregister-test.sh
crypt-test.sh
acl-test.sh
chmod-test.sh
putgetrm-test.sh

stress-test.sh

functions.sh, config.sh and stress-exec.sh are support files.
