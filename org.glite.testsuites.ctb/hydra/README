Tests for the Hydra server and client
Author: Kalle Happonen <kalle.happonen@cern.ch>

These scripts are prepared for testing the hydra server and client
functionality. hydra-server-test.sh is meant to be run on the server(s), the
rest of the tests need to be run on the client. For the testing purposes these
can be installed on the same machine. 

All script configuration is done in congfig.sh, or by setting the appropriate
environment variables. If nothing is specified, the defaults are used. The
client tests need the glite-UI to be set up properly.

All test are ran without parameters, and return 0 on success and 1 on error.
The client tests need at least one valid proxy certificate. If another one is
available, chmod-test.sh and acl-test.sh test that the permissions/ACL are
enforced. 

The more advanced tests use the commands tested in simpler ones, so the
recommended execution order on the client is:

ssss-test.sh
keyregister-test.sh
crypt-test.sh
acl-test.sh
chmod-test.sh
putgetrm-test.sh !NOTE! Does not run at the moment, hydra-client broken

functions.sh and config.sh are support files.
