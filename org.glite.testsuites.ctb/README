This is the collection of tests developed for CTB.

- Sensor directories should be named with capital letters.

- A 'skeleton' sensor SandBox is here to play with, to serve 
  as a starting point.

- For each sensor there should be a short description
  on: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/SAMTests

- CVS settings for SSH:

  export CVSROOT=:ext:<afs-user-name>@glite.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/glite
  export CVS_RSH=ssh

- Check out, change the RPM release number in lcg-sam-client-sensors-ctb.spec and launch 'make rpm'

  while

  /opt/lcg/same/client-ctb/bin/same-exec CE - will launch our CE tests
