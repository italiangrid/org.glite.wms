Bug: #31278
Link: https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?31278
Summary: WMS should prevent non-SDJ jobs from being scheduled on SDJ CEs

- Using the command 
  glite-wms-job-info --jdl <jobid> | grep -i requirements
  check if the expression RegExp(".*sdj$",other.GlueCEUniqueID); is present
  (the exact expression should be found in the configuration file on the
  WMS, section: WorkloadManagerProxy, parameter: SDJRequirements) 

- Setting ShortDeadlineJob=false; in the jdl, the previous command should
  contain the expression !RegExp(".*sdj$",other.GlueCEUniqueID)
