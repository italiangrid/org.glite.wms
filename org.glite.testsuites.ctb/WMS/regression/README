To create a regression test please follow this simple rules:

1) Create a description file: <bug number>.txt with this information:

Bug: <put the bug number>
Link: <link to savannah bug page>
Summary: <short description of the bug>

And then a list of actions that should be taken to test the bug.

2) If need create a jdl file: <bug number>.jdl

You can add also this attribute to jdl that could be useful for future checks:

usertags = [ bug = "<put bug number>" ];

3) If need create a bash script file: <bug_number>_exe.sh

You can found also a directory with some example file of data to use as InputSandBox 
and a directory with not silly executables.

These tests are _NOT_ supposed to be run automatically so some manual intervention
should be required also on the WMS machine.
