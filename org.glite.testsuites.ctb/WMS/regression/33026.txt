Summary: "no compatible resources" problem on SL4 WMS
                                                                                                                        
- set the II_Timeout parameter in the NetworkServr section of the
  glite_wms.conf file on the WMS to a very low value, as for ex.:
      II_Timeout  =  2;
                                                                                                                        
- re-start the WM and check the /var/glite/workload_manager/ismdump.fl does not get emptied
                                                                                                                        
- perform some job-list-match operation checking that it gets some match
  results
