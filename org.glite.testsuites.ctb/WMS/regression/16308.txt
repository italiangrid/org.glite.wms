Bug: #16308
Link: https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?16308
Summary: a subscription update is not working (doesn't set the new correct
expiration time) 

 - set the two parameters, subscription_update_threshold_time and
   subscription_duration in the ICE section of the glite_wms.conf file 
   to low values, such as the following:
                                   subscription_duration  =  300;
                                   subscription_update_threshold_time =  150;

   so that a subscription expires after 5 minutes

-  re-start ICE by the script '/opt/glite/etc/init.d/glite-wms-ice'

- submit a job and check the status of the subscription by the following
  command of the cream client:
    
           CEMonitorSubscriberMgr <cert_proxy> <cert_path> <service_URL_address>
