Bug: #28637
Link: https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?28637
Summary: Delegation IDs not found when CREAM persistence storage is cleared 

- create a delegated proxy with 'glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy -d pippo' on the wmproxy
  server of the wms machine

- submit a job to a cream CE via the wms using the previously created
  delegated proxy: glite-wms-job-submit myjob.jdl -d pippo 

- delete records for the user DN you are submitting with from the delegationdb on the CREAM CE, like the following:
   delete from t_credential where dn like '%Elisabetta%';
   delete from t_credential_cache where dn like '%Elisabetta%'; 

- submit a new normal job using the same delegated proxy as above;
