Here are some instructions on how to create a regression testing script to be included in the testsuite under 'org.glite.testsuites.ctb/WMS/regression/reg_tests'

Directory structure:
-----------------------

- bugs/ ---> contains  a testing script for each bug

- config/ ---> contains common utility functions to be used for testing WMS and running the regTest.sh script

- reports/ ---> a final report for each bug testing script detailing the results of the test

- test_dir/ ---> contains a .jdl or scripts or some data needed for running the testing script for each bug       

- testlists/ ---> contains files with the list of tests to be run by the main regTest.sh script

How to:
--------

For each new bug:
- create a testing script under the 'bugs' dir, adding any necessary file also under the 'test_dir' directory 
- add a line to the testlist file under the 'testlists' dir
- define a wms.conf file under the main dir specifying the wms machine under testing  
- main script runs by launching the following command './regTest.sh --testlists testlists/wms-tests-regression.txt'
