Summary: Maradona file should be removed at resubmission

- This bug can only verified manually using for example this procedure:

1) Submit a jdl
2) Log into the WMS
3) Look into the SandBox dir of the job until you see the "Maradona" file
4) Put the condor job (equivalent to your job previously submitted) on hold, 
   this should trigger a resubmission
5) When the job has been resubmitted check if the old "Maradona" file has 
   been removed
