Summary: A suicidal patch related issue

- Premises:
   o Current memory usage by CREAM is logged in ice log file 
     (/var/log/glite/ice.log) is rows such as this one:

2008-07-28 16:13:23,068 DEBUG - glite-wms-ice::main() - Used RSS Memory: 9780

   o Memory threshold is defined in the ICE section of the WMS conf file 
     (attribue max_ice_mem)

   o When 'current memory' > ' Memory threshold' the suicidal patch is triggered

- Try to trigger the suicidal patch, editing the WMS conf file and 
  setting a low enough value for max_ice_mem

- Restart ice: /opt/glite/etc/init.d/glite-wms-ice restart

- When the suicidal patch is triggered, you will see something like that
  in the log file

2008-07-28 16:45:27,591 FATAL - glite-wms-ice::main() - glite-wms-ice::main - 
Max memory reached [10532 kB] ! EXIT!

- Verify that after a while (5 min) ICE restarts
