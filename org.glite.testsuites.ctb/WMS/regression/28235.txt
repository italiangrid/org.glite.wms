Summary: Previously used CEs are not considered at all in the resubmission

- Change the jdl setting the name of an existing CE (in the requirements)
- At the end of the jobs with this command:
  glite-wms-job-logging-info -v 2 <jobid> | grep -A 2 Match | grep Dest
  you should see 3 times the name of the previously choosen CE.
  (The job must be Aborted with reason: hit job shallow retry count (2))
