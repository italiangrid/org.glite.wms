Before running FTS-submission be sure that:
- you have a valid AFS token if you are running the script from AFS space
- you have a valid voms proxy certificate
- you stored a long-term proxy into the MyProxy server.

Store a long-term proxy using:
myproxy-init -s lxbra2304.cern.ch -d -n

The meta-script FTS-certtest can be used to launch the tests.
Edit FTS-certconfig to set some details about the tests that will be
performed.

The file FTS-common has many general purpose functions useful to develop
more FTS test scripts.
