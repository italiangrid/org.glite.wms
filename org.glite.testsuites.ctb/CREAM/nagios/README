Probes for (gLite) Grid services. To be used with Nagios.

Grid services covered:
- CE:
  * CREAM - job submission via WMS
  * CREAM - direct job submission
- WN:
  * Check csh
  * Check software version
  * Check brokerinfo utility

The code is written in Python and uses 'gridmon' Python package, which is
provided by python-GridMon > v1.1.1 RPM.

The RPM also contains wrappers to launch "old" SAM checks (used for WN checks).

For documentation on probes/metrics please see the following resources.
