Python CREAM testing scripts - README
================================================================================

1) Requirements

The CREAM testsuite depends on the following packages:
- ZSI v.2.0, see http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/
- pyopenssl v.0.6, see http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/
- log4py v.1.3
- CREAM command line UI v.1.9 or higher
- CEMonitor command line UI v.1.9 or higher

2) Setup

The following environment variables must be defined:
- GLITE_LOCATION is the path for the gLite installation, it must contain the
  directory bin with the CREAM and CEMonitor command line tools
- PYTHONPATH must contain the paths for ZSI, pyopenssl and log4py modules

Whenever a test requires the customization of the log a file log4py.conf is
necessary, here it is a simple example of configuration:

    # Log4Py configuration file
    [Default]
    Format: %T %L %C [%F] - %M
    Target: stdout
    #Target: output.log
    Ansi: False
    LogLevel: Normal

For testing the setup of the testsuite just run a test with the "-h" option:

    cream-test-monitored-submit -h

3) Documentation

The set of man pages for the CREAM testsuite can be extracted from the python 
scripts:

    mkdir -p man/man1
    for testscript in `ls src/cream-test-*`; do
      HELP_FORMAT=GROFF ${testscript} -h > man/man1/`basename ${testscript}`.1
    done
    export MANPATH=MANPATH:$PWD/man
