# Analyse a list of commands and report those missing in the system.

# Note 1: "Missing in the system" here means that the command could not be found
# in the search path at the time the test was running.
# In principle the search path seen by the test could differ from that of the parent
# shell as well as other shell invocations.
# The simple sh shell is chosen for this script in order to minimize that effect.
# However keep in mind that shell environment may need extra attention.

# Note 2: This script currently uses the bash builtin, 'type', to locate a command.
# Older versions used 'which', but it appeared that 'which' is not installed on some systems.
# Another standard system command, 'whereis', runs slower than 'which' and may not find some commands.
