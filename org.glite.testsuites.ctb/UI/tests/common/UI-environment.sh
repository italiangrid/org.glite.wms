# This test helps to reveal common problems with environment variables,
# such as wrong entries in $PATH and "similar" variables.
# A failure is returned if a "single-entry" variable pointing to non-existing directory is found.
# For colon-separated lists, such as $PATH, only a warning will be shown.
#
# Usage: 
# UI-environment.sh - test environment seen from a bash script (~/.bashrc is executed)
# or
# source UI-environment.sh - test current shell environment (from bash only)
