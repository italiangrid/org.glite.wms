# Analyse a list of commands and report those missing in the system.

# Note that "missing in the system" here means that the command could not be found
# in the search path at the time the test was running.
# In principle the search path seen by the test could differ from that of the parent
# shell as well as other shell invocations.
# The simple sh shell is chosen for this script in order to minimize that effect.
# However keep in mind that shell environment may need extra attention.
