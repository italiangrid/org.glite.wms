Description:
============

This package is used to implement the redirection of standard input, 
output and error from the executing machine to a terminal on a remote machine.
All this stuff is heavily based and connected with the bypass package:
edg_wl_job_agent run an executable linking the STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR
to a remote terminal using edg_wl_pipe_input edg_wl_pipe_output that are 
compiled with the bypass libraries.
In this way there is no need to recompile the executables to implement the
job interactivity.
