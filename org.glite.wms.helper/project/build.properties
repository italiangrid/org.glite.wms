build.package.summary="Workload Manager Helpers"
build.package.description="The Workload Manager is the core component of the Workload Managment System. Given a valid request, it has to take the appropriate actions to satisfy it. Tu such an aim the Workload Manager may need support from other components, which are specific to the different request types. All these components that offer support to the Workload Manager provide a class whose interface is inherited from a Helper class, which consists of a single method resolve(). Essentially the Helper, given a JDL expression, returns a modified one, which represents the output of the required action. For example, if the request was to find a suitable resource for a job, the input JDL expression will be the one specified by the user at submission time, and the output will be the JDL expression augmented with the resource choice."
