YAIM - Yet Another Installation ManaYAIM1- Yet Another Installation Manager(1)
 
NAME
       yaim  -  YAIM  (YAIM Aint an Installation Manager) is, as the name sug-
       gests, a way of configuring Grid Services.  The aim of YAIM is to  pro-
       vide a simple installation and configuration method that can be used to
       set up a simple Grid Site but can be easily  adapted  and  extended  to
       meet the need of larger sites. The yaim-node-type module is configuring
       the NODE TYPE.
 
DESCRIPTION
       The yaim-wms module allows you to configure WMS
 
CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       This is the list of variables needed to set up in  order  to  configure
       the WMS.

       ables
 
       Mandatory Variables:
              sys  admins  must  ensure  these  variables are properly defined
              according to the features of the site
 
       site-info.def variables: VAR_1, VAR_2, VAR_3
 
       VARIABLE_1 : description. Value type.
 
       VARIABLE_2 : description. Value type.
 
       Optional Variables:
              sys admins do not need to change the value of these vari-
              ables since YAIM provides a suitable default value
 
       VARIABLE_3 : description. Value Type. Default value.
 
       Advanced configuration:
              sys  admins  should  not change the value of these
              variables unless they know what  they  are  doing.
              These  variables  are  used internally by YAIM and
              are    coming    with    default     values     in
              /opt/glite/yaim/defaults/node-type.pre(post).
              Their value can be  reset  in  your  site-info.def
              file if necessary.
 
       VARIABLE_4 : description. Value Type. Default Value.
